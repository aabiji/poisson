# Low earth orbit visualizer

Inspirations:
- https://orbital-watch-pink.vercel.app/
- https://www.jack-huston.com/TLE-Satellite-Plotter/

- Write comments explaining everything
- Add basic phong lighting on the gloe
  - Use the normal map and the specular map textures
- Propagate satellites on a seperate thread
- Improve circle rendering
  - Don't render occluded circles
  - Render the sphere in such a way that there are always fully circular no matter the rotation
- Decide whether to use the daymap or the nightmap based off of the simulated time (current user time?)
  Get starting position, then always propagate one timestamp into the future. Then just interpolate the position during the timestamp
- Click on a satellite to show info on it
- Trace satellite trajectories using a curved line
- Basic UI using imgui:
  - List of all the satellites (name, type, description)
  - Filter satellites by type, by producer, etc
- Issue HTTP requests to pull in new satellite csvs every few hours (maybe during app load to get fresh data?)
- Zoom in on your GPS position and highlight the swarm of satellites that are overhead
- Port to WASM, release project

- Low earth orbit: Orbit altitude of <= 2000 km.
- Drag: An opposing force exterted by the Earth's atmosphere on objects orbiting in LEO.
- SGP4: Simplified general pertubations 4
- TLE: Two-line element set. Although it's the de facto standard, it's very outdated (Y2K problems, running out of satellite identifiers, etc), so instead we'll be parsing CSV
- RAAN: The angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node.
- The eccentricty of an ellipse is the distance between the two foci [-sqrt(a^2 - b^2), -sqrt(a^2 - b^2)], divided by the semi major axis.

- Periapsis: Point in an orbit closest to the center of mass of a system.
- Apoapsis: Point in an orbit furthest from the center of mass of a system.
  - Perigee and apogee are terms used specifically for Earth.

- Orbital node: When an orbit intersects a plane of reference to which it's inclined.
  - Ascending node: When the orbit intersects the plane of reference moving north.
  - Descending node: When the orbit intersects the plane of reference moving south.
