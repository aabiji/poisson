# Low earth orbit visualizer

Inspiration: https://orbital-watch-pink.vercel.app/

Roadmap:
- Use the [sgp4](https://github.com/neuromorphicsystems/sgp4/) crate to propagate orbital data

    - Scale the propagation to thousands of satellites in 60 fps
        - Maybe compute every n seconds and simply interpolate the positions?

- Visualizer using WebGPU:

    - Basic space skybox

    - Texture a sphere using a texture of the Earth

        - Level of detail: Swap out the texture based off of the zoom level

    - Zoom a camera in/out, orbit around the earth

    - Render each satellite as a dot
        - Instanced rendering of circles and spheres
        - Don't render satellites that are behind the sphere

    - Trace the trajectories of the satellites using a curved line

- Basic UI using EGUI:

    - Filter satellites
        - Select specific satellites to track

    - Add a button to zoom in on your GPS position and highlight the satellites overhead the specific region

- Port to WASM, release project

- Low earth orbit: Orbit altitude of <= 2000 km.
- Drag: An opposing force exterted by the Earth's atmosphere on objects orbiting in LEO.
- SGP4: Simplified general pertubations 4
- TLE: Two-line element set. Although it's the de facto standard, it's very outdated (Y2K problems, running out of satellite identifiers, etc), so instead we'll be parsing CSV
- RAAN: The angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node.
- The eccentricty of an ellipse is the distance between the two foci [-sqrt(a^2 - b^2), -sqrt(a^2 - b^2)], divided by the semi major axis.

- Periapsis: Point in an orbit closest to the center of mass of a system.
- Apoapsis: Point in an orbit furthest from the center of mass of a system.
  - Perigee and apogee are terms used specifically for Earth.

- Orbital node: When an orbit intersects a plane of reference to which it's inclined.
  - Ascending node: When the orbit intersects the plane of reference moving north.
  - Descending node: When the orbit intersects the plane of reference moving south.
